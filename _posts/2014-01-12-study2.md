### 200% growth over 1 year

This small Internet start-up matched attorneys with potential clients through a proprietary algorithm. The company was slowly gaining traction, and the CEO wanted to increase monthly recurring revenue by penetrating new geographic markets.

After assessing their current set-up, I recommended two changes:

1. **Targeted messages.** The sales team was cold calling prospects in an attempt to generate business. This system was slow, and led to a high percentage of dead ends. My recommendation was to focus marketing efforts on a smaller number of higher quality leads: prospects already familiar with technology, and who were already using similar services at a similar price point. We filtered the list of leads and rewrote the call script to include language that would appeal to this specific target audience.
2. **Better split testing.** The new call script required split testing to ensure the new language made an impact. I recommended implementing a centralized system to track how successful each version of the new script was at converting leads to paying customers.

My recommendations increased paid memberships 200% over 1 year.
