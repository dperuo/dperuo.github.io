###  Complete Rebranding of a Fitness Company

Founded in 2007 as a boutique personal training firm, the original plan for this company was to work with athletes and students. But after two years of no significant growth, the company needed help. Without quick intervention, it was doomed to fail.

After careful analysis, I made two changes:

1. **Reposition in another niche.** The clients who brought in the most consistent long-term business were not athletes, but were actually finance professionals with no connection whatsoever to sports. I pivoted the company to forget training athletes, and to position itself instead as an expert in training finance professionals.
2. **Rebrand the entire company.** The change in unique selling proposition required a complete rebranding of the company, including a new name, a new design, new service packages, and a new voice for the marketing materials. The company was renamed, and all of the marketing was rewritten to include language and service options that would resonate on an emotional level with the new target market.

These changes reduced advertising costs 25% over 6 months, raised client retention to 84% in about that same time, and generated $30,000 in additional revenue over the following year.
