Hello. My name is Derek.

I value simplicity and elegance, and like working with nimble teams of creative people.

My interests include health and well-being; food and wine; art and theatre; design and technology; luxury and hospitality; and lifelong learning.

Email and GitHub are the best ways to contact me. Feel free to connect and discover more about all the projects I'm working on.
