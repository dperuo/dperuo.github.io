Hello. My name is Derek. I work in marketing.

#### Once upon a time

I wanted to be an actor and had dreams of winning Oscars and Tony Awards. I went to acting classes on the weekends; I attended The School of Performing Arts at LaGuardia High School; and I eventually got my BFA in Acting from DePaul University in Chicago. While at college, I became a personal trainer and taught myself all about health and exercise.

To build a successful training business, I learned how to market my services. And the more I read about marketing and advertising, the more I realized how valuable my theatre training actually was.

#### Creating story

For me, marketing is all about understanding intention and motivation; obstacle and story. It's about building connection with my customers, and positioning them as the protagonist of their own story.

I'm having a lot of fun building marketing campaigns, and my goal now is to move on from personal training and to focus on providing value for other companies as a marketing professional.

#### Simplicity and elegance

I value simplicity and elegance, and work best in a fast-paced environment full of creative people where there are new challenges every day, and where I have to think on my feet.

Other interests include health and well-being; food and wine; art and theatre; design and technology; luxury and hospitality; and lifelong learning.

#### Connect with you

Email and GitHub are the best ways to contact me. Feel free to connect and discover more about all the projects I'm working on.
