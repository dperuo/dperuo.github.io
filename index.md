Hello. My name is Derek. I work in marketing.

For me, marketing is about understanding intention and motivation; obstacle and story. It's about building connection with my customers, and positioning them as the protagonist of their own story.

I value simplicity and elegance, and work best in a fast-paced environment full of creative people where there are new challenges every day, and where I have to think on my feet.

Other interests include health and well-being; food and wine; art and theatre; design and technology; luxury and hospitality; and lifelong learning.

Email and GitHub are the best ways to contact me. Feel free to connect and discover more about all the projects I'm working on.
